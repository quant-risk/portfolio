Hi there! I'm a quant risk management professional + Master in Applied Economics, and passionate about empirical validation analysis. 

I have ‚Äúrevealed preference‚Äù for matcha üçµ and coffee ‚òï, pizza üçï, microeconomics, econometrics, microeconometrics and R. 

A concept that I always apply is: The whole intention of empirical economics is to force theory down to Earth. - George Akerlof.


My motto is: **Be better than average**.


At my house, my [wife](https://www.instagram.com/kedmathaynara/) and I play with our children Arya, Frodo and Lunna (Three beautiful kittens). We love and enjoy brunch on Sundays and are always willing to try great food.
