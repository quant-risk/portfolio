# Contact {{< fa paper-plane >}}

You can use this form to contact me to say hello. I'm always willing to read and listen to anyone who wants to talk about economics, data science, risk management, or statistics.

Any time spent talking to people on the Internet about these topics is time saved. I'm the annoying friend who loves talking about curiosities and refusing to talk about normal things (I don't know what normal people talk about).

I also love knowing if my materials were helpful to you and how they could be improved â€“ especially if they could be more accessible.

However, for queries related to consultancy, collaborations or speaking engagements, please visit the [consultancy](/consultancy) page.
